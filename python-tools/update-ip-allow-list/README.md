# Update IP Allow List with Python

This project demonstrates how to automate the update of an allow list of IP addresses using a Python script.

## 📄 Files
- update-a-file-through-a-python-algorithm.pdf – Detailed explanation of the algorithm used to update the IP allow list.

## 💻 Scenario
As a cybersecurity analyst, I created a Python algorithm that removes IP addresses from an approved list based on a removal list. The script reads the `allow_list.txt` file, filters out unwanted IPs, and rewrites the file without them—streamlining access control and reducing human error.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods
- Python 3
- File I/O (`open`, `read`, `write`)
- String and list manipulation methods (`split()`, `join()`, `remove()`)
